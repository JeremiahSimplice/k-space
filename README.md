# assignment
Data Structure and Algorithms, Heaps. 

Using java programming, I constructed Prog7.java and Astro.java with applied generics to create a reusable data structure.
This assignment uses heap and priority queue concepts to solve a real-world problem. I avoided full sorting with o (n log n). I also had to calculate Euclidean distance to model astronomical proximity.
