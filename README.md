Data Structure and Algorithms, Heaps. 

Using java programming, I constructed Prog7.java and Astro.java with applied generics to create a reusable data structure.
This assignment uses heap and priority queue concepts to solve a real-world problem. I avoid a full sort o(nlogn) with a min-heap to retrieve k closest entities. Euclidean distance calculations were used to model astronomical proximity.
